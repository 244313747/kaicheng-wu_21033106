Neural Art Generator
This is a Python program that allows you to generate artistic images using deep learning and image processing techniques.

Features
Image classification: The program can classify images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
Fast style transfer: The program can apply artistic styles to input images using a pre-trained model based on neural style transfer.
3D image generation: The program can generate 3D images using NumPy by creating a grid of points and applying a mathematical function to define the shape of the surface.
