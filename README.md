The content of the system includes a digital clock based on reading the system time,
an animation effect of a layer of raindrops falling, with the ticking sound of the clock and the sound of rain.
A digital clock and raindrops combine to create a relaxing animation, supplemented by white noise music with random volume changes,
it creates a feeling of ignoring the external environment when entering a state of concentration.
So that the whole system can be used to zone out yourself, and it can also be used as wallpaper.
