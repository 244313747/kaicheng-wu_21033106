I study the problem of machine learning, whose goal is to train a Its goal is to train a chatbot,
call a corpus with the theme of constellations supplemented by chat (e.g., dataset called AIML with some new corpus written by myself),
and conduct the most simulated human-machine dialogue. While the chatting part, the anthropomorphic of a robot, i.e. how plausible a conversation is, is a hot topic. 
Domain-specific corpus dialogue is less explored in the literature, large amount of datasets are also necessary to train the bot into smarter. 
Without enriching datasets, directly repeated training applied to chatbot often leads to too one-sided dialogue direction.
