Project Title: Ripples with Sound

Description:
This project combines the visual effect of ripples with interactive sound playback. When the user moves the mouse on the screen, ripples are generated around the mouse cursor, creating a visually appealing effect. Additionally, the user can click on the canvas to start or stop a sound playback, which adds an interactive audio component to the project.

Functionality:

1. Ripple Generation:
   - Moving the mouse on the canvas generates ripples around the cursor.
   - Each ripple expands in size and fades out gradually.
   - The color of each ripple is randomly assigned, creating a colorful visual effect.

2. Sound Playback:
   - A sound sample is loaded and played using the Maximilian library.
   - The sound playback is triggered by a mouse click on the canvas.
   - Clicking again stops the sound playback.
   - The sound sample is randomly triggered at specific intervals during playback.

------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:

1. Mouse Movement:
   - Move the mouse cursor on the canvas to generate ripples.
   - Ripples will appear around the cursor as you move it.

2. Sound Playback:
   - Click anywhere on the canvas to start or stop the sound playback.
   - When the sound is playing, the ripples will be accompanied by the audio.

Technical Details:

1. HTML and CSS:
   - The project is implemented as an HTML page with embedded JavaScript code.
   - The canvas element is used for drawing the ripples.
   - CSS is applied to style the canvas and ensure it occupies the full screen.

2. JavaScript and Libraries:
   - JavaScript is used to handle mouse events, draw ripples, and control sound playback.
   - The Maximilian library is used for audio processing and sound sample loading.

3. Ripples:
   - Ripples are generated by moving the mouse cursor on the canvas.
   - Each ripple expands in size, changes color, and fades out gradually.
   - The ripples are drawn using the HTML5 Canvas API.

4. Sound Playback:
   - A sound sample (wave.mp3) is loaded using the Maximilian library.
   - The sound playback is triggered by a mouse click event on the canvas.
   - Clicking again stops the sound playback.
   - The sound sample is randomly triggered at specific intervals during playback.
